# Active Context: Dutyback Helper

## Current Work Focus
The project is in **active development** with a substantial foundation already built. The core architecture is established and multiple components are implemented.

## Recent Development Activity
Based on the codebase analysis, significant progress has been made:

### âœ… Completed Components
- **Wizard System**: Multi-step form with conditional routing logic
- **Dashboard**: Claims management with filtering and stats
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe checkout and webhook handling
- **File Upload**: Evidence document handling with Supabase Storage
- **Analytics**: Success rate tracking and outcome statistics
- **Courier Playbooks**: DHL, FedEx, UPS guidance modals
- **Branch Screens**: BOR286, VAT Return, Seller Refund info screens
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive Shadcn/UI component library
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth integration
- **Real-time Updates**: Live claim status updates

### ðŸ”„ Currently In Progress
The codebase shows a mature application with most core features implemented. The focus appears to be on:
- **Polish and Refinement**: Multiple wizard page variants (enhanced, polished)
- **Component Optimization**: Advanced UI components with animations
- **Feature Completion**: Finalizing remaining screens and flows

## Next Steps & Priorities

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Review Current Implementation**: Assess what's working and what needs refinement
2. **Test Core Flows**: Validate wizard routing logic and payment processing
3. **Complete Missing Screens**: Ensure all 16 screens from PRD are implemented
4. **Data Model Validation**: Verify Supabase schema matches requirements
5. **Integration Testing**: Test end-to-end user journeys

### Key Areas for Attention
1. **Wizard Routing Logic**: Ensure HMRC routing rules are correctly implemented
2. **Evidence Validation**: Verify mandatory document checklists are enforced
3. **Claim Pack Generation**: Test PDF/ZIP export functionality
4. **Payment Flow**: Validate Stripe integration and webhook handling
5. **Real-time Features**: Test claim status updates and notifications

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Decisions
- **Multiple Wizard Variants**: Three versions suggest iterative improvement approach
- **Advanced UI Components**: Heavy use of animations and 3D graphics for engagement
- **Comprehensive Component Library**: 75+ UI components indicate mature design system

### Product Decisions
- **Pricing Strategy**: Multiple tiers (Â£9 basic, Â£19 premium) implemented
- **User Experience**: Focus on guided, step-by-step process
- **Trust Building**: Analytics and outcome tracking for transparency

## Current Challenges
1. **Complex Routing Logic**: HMRC rules are intricate and change frequently
2. **Evidence Validation**: Ensuring all mandatory documents are captured
3. **Courier Integration**: Manual playbooks vs automated API integration
4. **Policy Drift**: Keeping HMRC guidance up-to-date
5. **User Education**: Making complex processes accessible

## Development Environment
- **Port**: 3001 (configured in package.json)
- **Build Tool**: Turbopack for faster development
- **Hot Reload**: Enabled for rapid iteration
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking enabled

## Quality Assurance Focus
1. **User Journey Testing**: End-to-end validation of all wizard paths
2. **Payment Processing**: Stripe webhook and checkout flow testing
3. **File Upload Security**: Document validation and storage
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Cross-device compatibility
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance for inclusive design

## Collaboration Notes
- **Documentation**: Memory Bank established for project continuity
- **Code Organization**: Well-structured component hierarchy
- **Configuration**: Environment variables properly separated
- **Version Control**: Git repository with proper .gitignore
